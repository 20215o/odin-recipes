# Odin Recipes  

This is my first project from The Odin Project curriculum.  
Itâ€™s a simple HTML website that contains a main index page with links to a few recipes.  

**Skills demonstrated:**  
- Structuring a basic HTML project  
- Using headings, paragraphs, links, and images  
- Working with Git and GitHub (version control)  

This project will later be revisited and styled with CSS.
